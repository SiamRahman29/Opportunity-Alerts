<h1>Welcome to the Repository of Opportunity Octopus</h1>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
It is a very simple web application built with Django and Python. It offers a compilation of various kinds of opportunities aimed at university students,
for example: hackathons, scholarship, and competitions. This open source project is aimed at beginner software engineers who are starting their journey of 
contributing to open source GitHub projects. 

<h2>Instructions on Running the Project</h2>

The project is currently being deployed via an AWS server <a href = "http://ec2-54-255-244-103.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/">here</a>.

If you want to run it locally, the easiest way is via Docker. Set up Docker on your local machine (Docker Desktop for Windows). Then from the project's directory,
open a terminal and run "sudo docker compose up" without the quotations.
